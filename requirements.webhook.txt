# WhatsApp Webhook Requirements for Vercel Deployment
# Python 3.9 runtime

# Core dependencies (minimal for serverless)
# Note: urllib is built-in, no external dependencies needed for basic webhook

# Optional: For enhanced features (add if needed)
# requests==2.31.0          # If you prefer requests over urllib
# python-dotenv==1.0.0      # For local development
# sentry-sdk==1.40.0        # For error tracking
# redis==5.0.1              # For caching/queuing (if using Redis)

# The current implementation uses only Python standard library
# This ensures minimal cold start time and maximum reliability
